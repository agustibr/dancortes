Hey, welcome to my new website. There are loads of things I want to learn and write about in the near future, some of which I hope are of interest to you.

First, introductions. I'm Dan, and I currently work as a digital strategist at [Punchkick&nbsp;Interactive](https://www.punchkick.com/)—an end-to-end mobile marketing, design, and development agency. It's a terrific Chicago agency that's focused on making the best mobile native and web experiences possible.

As a strategist, my job is to come up with solutions to our clients' needs, and to work with the team to see the execution through—from design, to development, launch, and promotion. Given the breadth of the role, I've picked up a few different skills that have turned into major hobbies.

Among them are user experience design, prototyping, front-end development, marketing, and animation. This blog is where I'll be writing about them.

The first post will be about how this site came to be. I made it using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a great tool for building build blog-aware static sites. Jekyll is only one piece of the puzzle, though. We'll talk about the rest of the process—from getting a domain, to hosting, to mocking up the site, design inspiration, to building the site, and getting it up on the internet.

If you're new to web design, and you're interested in what putting together a relatively simple website looks like, it'll be worth your time.
