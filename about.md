I'm Dan—a digital strategist, marketer, writer, designer, and hobbyist developer. But enough about that, let's talk about the real me.

### **I'm from Chile**

On June 15th, 1989, in Santiago, Chile, I crawled out of my mom and said, "World, I'm ready for you. I hope you're ready for me." Except I said it in baby Spanish, because I was a baby and I was in South America.

I was born in Chile, and lived the first 8 years of my life there. I've been in the States since '98. I will always call the US home, but part of my heart will always belong to the motherland.

### **I live in Chicago**

Since I moved to the United States, I've lived near Chicago. I've lived in Chicago proper for the last 5 years. It is my favorite city. There are so many interesting places to go, great places to eat, and the tech scene is blowing up—and somehow it's still afforable. Oh, right, it's because in the winter, the temperature goes down to -40°.

### **I like bikes**

I love riding my bike, especially in the beautiful streets of Chicago—even in winter. I'm currently on that so-last-year fixed gear game, but I'm looking for a nice road bike to take on long trips.

I also enjoy working on bikes, so hit me up if you're in need of an extra set of hands.

### **I like beer**

I'm an avid craft beer fan, and homebrewer. My favorite type of restaurant is a brewpub. A relaxing Saturday for me is spending 6 hours in the kitchen concocting an all-new brew.
